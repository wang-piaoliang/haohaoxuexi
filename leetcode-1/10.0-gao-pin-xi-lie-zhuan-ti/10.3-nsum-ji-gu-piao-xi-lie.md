# 10.3 NSum及股票系列

## NSum系列 <a id="NSum%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97"></a>

### [1. 2Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/two-sum/) <a id="1.-2Sum"></a>

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have _**exactly**_ one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

**Example:**

```text
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

**Solution**

1. 一边Dict

2. 排序，双指针，Onlogn

### [**15. 3Sum**](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/3sum/) <a id="15.-3Sum"></a>

[3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

Given an array nums of _n_ integers, are there elements _a_, _b_, _c_ in nums such that _a_ + _b_ + _c_ = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

**Note:**

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example:**

```text
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

[思路](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/3sum/solution/3sumpai-xu-shuang-zhi-zhen-yi-dong-by-jyd/) 排序+双指针，On2，固定一个i，l,r从左右开始扫描

### [18. 4Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/4sum/) <a id="18.-4Sum"></a>

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers and an integer `target`, are there elements _a_, _b_, _c_, and _d_ in `nums` such that _a_ + _b_ + _c_ + _d_ = `target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of `target`.

**Note:**

The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

**Example:**

```text
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

**Solution**

和3Sum思路一样，固定两个再双指针，On3

// 第i天的没有股票的状态 = Max(前一天就没有，前一天有但今天卖出了) 
profit[i][0] = Math.max(profit[i - 1][0], profit[i - 1][1] + prices[i]); 
// 第i天的有股票的状态 = Max(前一天就有了，前一天没有今天买了) 
profit[i][1] = Math.max(profit[i - 1][1], profit[i - 1][0] - prices[i]);

### [**121. 买卖股票的最佳时机**](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/solution/) <a id="121.-%E4%B9%B0%E5%8D%96%E8%82%A1%E7%A5%A8%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%80%E4%BD%B3%E6%97%B6%E6%9C%BA"></a>

Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction \(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock\), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Solution**

维护最小值，不断更新最大收益

```text
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices: return 0
        
        dp = [0]*len(prices)
        min_v = prices[0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            min_v = min(min_v, prices[i])
            dp[i] = prices[i] - min_v
            
        return max(dp)
```

### [122. 买卖股票的最佳时机 II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/) <a id="122.-%E4%B9%B0%E5%8D%96%E8%82%A1%E7%A5%A8%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%80%E4%BD%B3%E6%97%B6%E6%9C%BA-II"></a>

Say you have an array `prices` for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like \(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times\).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Solution**

只要后一天比前一天大，就交易

Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most _two_ transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

### [188. 买卖股票的最佳时机 IV](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/) <a id="188.-%E4%B9%B0%E5%8D%96%E8%82%A1%E7%A5%A8%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%80%E4%BD%B3%E6%97%B6%E6%9C%BA-IV"></a>

Say you have an array for which the _i-_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most **k** transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
